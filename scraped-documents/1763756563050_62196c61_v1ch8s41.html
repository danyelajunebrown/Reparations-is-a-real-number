<p>1. <i>Resolved,</i> That the several States composing the United
States of America, are not united on the principle of unlimited
submission to their General Government; but that,
by a compact under the style and title of a Constitution for
the United States, and of amendments thereto, they constituted
a General Government for special purposes,--delegated
to that government certain definite powers, reserving,
each State to itself, the residuary mass of right to their
own self-government; and that whensoever the General
Government assumes undelegated powers, its acts are
unauthoritative, void, and of no force: that to this compact
each State acceded as a State, and is an integral party, its
co-States forming, as to itself, the other party: that the
government created by this compact was not made the exclusive
or final judge of the extent of the powers delegated
to itself; since that would have made its discretion, and not
the Constitution, the measure of its powers; but that, as in
all other cases of compact among powers having no common
judge, each party has an equal right to judge for itself,
as well of infractions as of the mode and measure of
redress.</p>
<p ALIGN="CENTER">. . . . .</p>
<p>8th. <i>Resolved,</i> That a committee of conference and correspondence
be appointed, who shall have in charge to
communicate the preceding resolutions to the legislatures
of the several States; to assure them that this commonwealth
continues in the same esteem of their friendship
and union which it has manifested from that moment at
which a common danger first suggested a common union:
that it considers union, for specifed national purposes, and
particularly to those specified in their late federal compact,
to be friendly to the peace, happiness and prosperity of all
the States: that faithful to that compact, according to the
plain intent and meaning in which it was understood and
acceded to by the several parties, it is sincerely anxious for
its preservation: that it does also believe, that to take from
the States all the powers of self-government and transfer
them to a general and consolidated government, without
regard to the special delegations and reservations solemnly
agreed to in that compact, is not for the peace, happiness
or prosperity of these States; and that therefore this commonwealth
is determined, as it doubts not its co-States are,
to submit to undelegated, and consequently unlimited
powers in no man, or body of men on earth: that in cases
of an abuse of the delegated powers, the members of the
General Government, being chosen by the people, a
change by the people would be the constitutional remedy;
but, where powers are assumed which have not been delegated,
a nullification of the act is the rightful remedy:
that every State has a natural right in cases not within the
compact, (casus non foederis,) to nullify of their own authority
all assumptions of power by others within their limits:
that without this right, they would be under the dominion,
absolute and unlimited, of whosoever might
exercise this right of judgment for them: that nevertheless,
this commonwealth, from motives of regard and respect
for its co-States, has wished to communicate with them on
the subject: that with them alone it is proper to communicate,
they alone being parties to the compact, and solely
authorized to judge in the last resort of the powers exercised
under it, Congress being not a party, but merely the
creature of the compact, and subject as to its assumptions
of power to the final judgment of those by whom, and for
whose use itself and its powers were all created and modified:
that if the acts before specified should stand, these
conclusions would flow from them; that the General Government
may place any act they think proper on the list of
crimes, and punish it themselves whether enumerated or
not enumerated by the Constitution as cognizable by them:
that they may transfer its cognizance to the President, or
any other person, who may himself be the accuser, counsel,
judge and jury, whose <i>suspicions</i> may be the evidence,
his <i>order</i> the sentence, his <i>officer</i> the executioner, and his
breast the sole record of the transaction: that a very numerous
and valuable description of the inhabitants of
these States being, by this precedent, reduced, as outlaws,
to the absolute dominion of one man, and the barrier of
the Constitution thus swept away from us all, no rampart
now remains against the passions and the powers of a majority
in Congress to protect from a like exportation, or
other more grievous punishment, the minority of the same
body, the legislatures, judges, governors, and counsellors
of the States, nor their other peaceable inhabitants, who
may venture to reclaim the constitutional rights and liberties
of the States and people, or who for other causes,
good or bad, may be obnoxious to the views, or marked by
the suspicions of the President, or be thought dangerous
to his or their election, or other interests, public or personal:
that the friendless alien has indeed been selected as the
safest subject of a first experiment; but the citizen will soon
follow, or rather, has already followed, for already has a
sedition act marked him as its prey: that these and successive
acts of the same character, unless arrested at the
threshold, necessarily drive these States into revolution
and blood, and will furnish new calumnies against republican
government, and new pretexts for those who wish it
to be believed that man cannot be governed but by a rod
of iron: that it would be a dangerous delusion were a confidence
in the men of our choice to silence our fears for
the safety of our rights: that confidence is everywhere the
parent of despotism--free government is founded in jealousy,
and not in confidence; it is jealousy and not confidence
which prescribes limited constitutions, to bind down
those whom we are obliged to trust with power: that our
Constitution has accordingly fixed the limits to which, and
no further, our confidence may go; and let the honest advocate
of confidence read the alien and sedition acts, and<!--[Volume 1, Page 293]-->
say if the Constitution has not been wise in fixing limits to
the government it created, and whether we should be wise
in destroying those limits. Let him say what the government
is, if it be not a tyranny, which the men of our choice
have conferred on our President, and the President of our
choice has assented to, and accepted over the friendly
strangers to whom the mild spirit of our country and its
laws have pledged hospitality and protection: that the men
of our choice have more respected the bare <i>suspicions</i> of
the President, than the solid right of innocence, the claims
of justification, the sacred force of truth, and the forms
and substance of law and justice. In questions of power,
then, let no more be heard of confidence in man, but bind
him down from mischief by the chains of the Constitution.
That this commonwealth does therefore call on its co-States
for an expression of their sentiments on the acts
concerning aliens, and for the punishment of certain
crimes herein before specified, plainly declaring whether
these acts are or are not authorized by the federal compact.
And it doubts not that their sense will be so announced
as to prove their attachment unaltered to limited
government, whether general or particular. And that the
rights and liberties of their co-States will be exposed to no
dangers by remaining embarked in a common bottom with
their own. That they will concur with this commonwealth
in considering the said acts as so palpably against the Constitution
as to amount to an undisguised declaration that
that compact is not meant to be the measure of the powers
of the General Government, but that it will proceed in the
exercise over these States, of all powers whatsoever: that
they will view this as seizing the rights of the States, and
consolidating them in the hands of the General Government,
with a power assumed to bind the States, (not
merely as the cases made federal, (casus foederis,) but in
all cases whatsoever, by laws made, not with their consent,
but by others against their consent: that this would be to
surrender the form of government we have chosen, and
live under one deriving its powers from its own will, and
not from our authority; and that the co-States, recurring
to their natural right in cases not made federal, will concur
in declaring these acts void, and of no force, and will each
take measures of its own for providing that neither these
acts, nor any others of the General Government not
plainly and intentionally authorized by the Constitution,
shall be exercised within their respective territories.</p>
<p>9th. <i>Resolved,</i> That the said committee be authorized to
communicate by writing or personal conferences, at any
times or places whatever, with any person or persons who
may be appointed by any one or more co-States to correspond
or confer with them; and that they lay their proceedings
before the next session of Assembly.</p>
