### 4. Ethical Considerations

**CRITICAL - Privacy & Consent:**

Since Marjorie Lyman Miller is:
- ✅ Living
- ✅ Known to the user
- ✅ Recently experienced family loss

**We MUST:**
1. **Respect privacy** - Do not publicly post personal information
2. **Obtain consent** - Before using her name in reparations calculations
3. **Sensitive timing** - Family just experienced loss of Arthur
4. **Opt-in model** - She must choose to participate
5. **Clear communication** - Explain the reparations research

**Recommended Approach:**
```
Wait appropriate time after funeral (2-4 weeks) → 
Contact Marjorie respectfully →
Explain research about James Hopewell →
Request permission to include her in descendant documentation →
If yes: Proceed with lineage documentation →
If no: Respect wishes, document only deceased ancestors
```
